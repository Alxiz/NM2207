## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

`{r. echo=FALSE} library(tidyverse) library(palmerpenguins) glimpse(penguins)`

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyverse)
library(palmerpenguins)
ggplot(data = penguins, #Start with the penguins data frame
mapping = aes(x = bill_depth_mm, #Map bill depth to the x-axis
y = bill_length_mm, #Map bill length to the y-axis
colour = species)) + #Map species to the colour of each point
geom_point() + #Represent each observation with a point
labs(title = "Bill depth and length", #Title the plot "Bill depth and length"
subtitle = "Dimensions for Adelie, Chinstrap, and Gentoo Penguins", #Add the subtitle "Dimensions for Adelie, Chinstrap, and Gentoo Penguins"
x = "Bill depth (mm)", y = "Bill length (mm)", #Label the x and y axes as "Bill depth (mm)" and "Bill length (mm)", respectively
colour = "Species", #Label the legend "Species"
caption = "Source: Palmer Station LTER", #Add a caption for the data source
scale_colour_viridis_d()) #Use a discrete colour scale that is designed to be perceived by viewers with common forms of colour blindness.
```

```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
ggplot(penguins, #Start with the penguins data frame
aes(x = bill_depth_mm, y = bill_length_mm, #Mapping the x and y axis
colour = species, #Separate each specie by colour
shape = species, #Separate each specie by shape
size = body_mass_g, #The size of the shape is determined by the mass
alpha = flipper_length_mm)) + #Modify transparency
geom_point() + #Represent each observation with a point
scale_colour_viridis_d() #Use a discrete colour scale that is designed to be perceived by viewers with common forms of colour blindness. 
```
