## Questions
<br>

#### Question-1: Countdown Blastoff (While Loop)

Create a program that simulates a rocket launch countdown using a while loop. Start from 10 and countdown to "Blastoff!" with a one-second delay between each countdown number. Print a message when the rocket launches.

**Hint:** You may want to use `cat` command to print the countdown and `Sys.sleep` for incorporating the delay

**Output preview:** Here is how the countdown could look like 

**Solutions:**

```{r, eval=TRUE,echo=TRUE}
# Enter code here
countdown <- function(start) {
  while (start > 0) {
    cat(start, "\n")
    start <- start - 1
    Sys.sleep(1)
  }
  cat("Blastoff!\n")
}
countdown(10)
```

#### Question-2: Word Reverser (for Loop)

Develop a program that takes a user-entered word and uses a while loop to print the word's characters in reverse order. For example, if the user enters "hello," the program should print "olleh."

**Hint:** You may want to use `substr` command to access each character of the input word, and `paste` command to join the reversed letters one at a time

**Solutions:** 

```{r, eval=TRUE,echo=TRUE}
# Enter code here
reverse_word <- function(word) {
  length_word <- nchar(word)

  for (i in length_word:1) {
    cat(substr(word, i, i))
  }
  cat("\n")
}

user_input <- readline("Enter a word: ")

reverse_word(user_input)
```
